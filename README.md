- [x] clap - argument parsing
- [x] parse files,
- [x] `-d` debug mode, prints tape at the end, enables the use of `!TAPE` to print 10 nearest values on the tape at any point of the program
- [ ] `-i` input file to use for stdin, could also be taken from a pipe
- [x] `-n` numerical mode, prints values themselves instead of interpreting them as ascii.
